Most modern web applications are powered by a REST API under the hood. That way, developers can separate the front-end code from the back-end logic, and users can interact with the interface dynamically. In this three-part tutorial series, you’ll build a REST API with the Flask web framework.

You’ll create a foundation with a basic Flask project then add endpoints and connect them to a SQLite database. You’ll test your API with Swagger UI API documentation that you’ll build along the way.

In the first part of this tutorial series, you’ll learn how to:

    Build a base Flask project with a REST API
    Handle HTTP requests with Connexion
    Define API endpoints using the OpenAPI specification
    Interact with your API to manage data
    Build API documentation with Swagger UI

After finishing the first part of this series, you’ll move on to the second part, where you’ll learn to use a proper database to store your data permanently instead of relying on in-memory storage.

This tutorial series is a hand-on guide on how to create a REST API with Flask and interact with it using CRUD operations. If you want to refresh your knowledge on working with APIs, then you can give Python and REST APIs: Interacting With Web Services a read.

finally some info for git:
…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# flask_api_GP" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/devo2ps/flask_api_GP.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/devo2ps/flask_api_GP.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


basic workflow

<do stuff>
git add .  (adds everything that has changed into the buffer)
git commit -m "say whatever you did"
git push -u origin main (now updates the hub)


anyways...
